<h1>JavaScript Theory</h1>
<h2>Computational thinking</h2>
<p>It is the term used to describe what it means to think like a computer, It's all about using the specific and unique capabilities of computers - It's all about using the specific and unique capabilities of compurters to solve problems.</p>
<p>JavaScript - and other programming languages - act like translators between your human thoughts and what the computer understands.</p>
<h2>Four Principles of Computational Thinking</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Decomposition</li>
	<li>Abstraction</li>
	<li>Pattern Recognition</li>
	<li>Algorithim Writing</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Decomposition</h3>
<p>Is the process of braking down a big problem into smaller ones, untill all the probles are small enough to easily solve. Sole each one of those small problems one at the time and then, your big problem is solved</p>
<h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
<p>Now that you've used decomposition to turn your big problem into smaller problems, it is time to look at the smaller problems and see if they have any commonalties or if you can use similar methods to solve them.</p>
<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p>The goal is to omit specific details and to focus on the general patterns. In other words, your task is to solve a very simplified version of the problem you are trying to solve.</p>
<h3>Algorithm Writing</h3>
<p>In reality, is much simplier than it sounds: it just means writing a series of instructions that explain how to solve aproblem. Although algorithms are use a TON in computer programming like in any set of instructions. </p>
